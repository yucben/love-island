"""What is playing, and the buttons to steer it.

Every media player on the session bus registers a name under
``org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.*`` and announces what it is doing through the usual
``PropertiesChanged`` signal.  Listening to that is enough to notice a track
change, get its title, artist and cover, and to send Previous / PlayPause /
Next back — no player-specific code anywhere.

Unlike the notification service this takes nothing away from anybody: we only
listen, so Plasma's media applet keeps working exactly as before.
