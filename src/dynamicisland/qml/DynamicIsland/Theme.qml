 * What the island is made of: four palettes and the numbers that do not
 * change with them.
 *
 * The default is tuned for an OLED panel — the body is true black, so those
 * pixels are simply off, and every other surface is a very dark grey that
 * still reads as "raised" against it. That is the look this project is for,
 * but a black pill on a light desktop is a hole in the screen, so there are
 * three more:
 *
 *   amoled  true black, the one the island was designed around
 *   dark    a dark grey body, for panels where black would bloom or smear
 *   light   dark type on white
 *   system  whatever the desktop's colour scheme says, read off the palette
 *
 * `mode` is set from the configuration in main.qml rather than read here: a
 * QML singleton has no business reaching into the application's context.
